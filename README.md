# IITR-Internship
Real-time IoT monitoring system built during my internship at IIT Roorkee. Engineered an end-to-end data pipeline (ESP32 → MQTT Broker → Java Backend → Web Dashboard) with WebSocket-based live updates. Implemented backend APIs, authentication flows, and optimized latency for stable real-time data streaming.
